<div class="space-y-6 leading-relaxed text-slate-300">

<p>
Love is a universal human experience, a profound force capable of bridging differences in race, culture, and social background. However, when love manifests between two individuals holding fundamentally different religious beliefs a phenomenon known as interfaith dating—this powerful emotional force is rigorously tested by faith. In the modern digital age, these relationships are further complicated by the tension between personal commitment and societal or spiritual expectations. Although interfaith dating is characterized by fundamental spiritual differences, functional empathy manifested through active listening and the recognition of the inherent value in a partner’s unique faith is the primary key that allows couples to build a resilient, mutually respectful foundation.
</p>

<p>
One of the primary conflict points in interfaith relationships is the dilemma of rituals and holiday celebrations. Without empathy, these moments can become zero-sum conflicts where one partner's celebration feels like an invalidation of the other's. Functional empathy transforms this conflict into an opportunity for "shared presence". It enables a partner to participate respectfully in the cultural or familial aspects of a ritual without necessarily committing to the underlying theology. This approach honors the partner's spiritual identity without requiring one to compromise their own beliefs.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the most potent threats to these unions often come from external sources, such as familial pressure and communal stigma. This external stress can easily exacerbate internal tension. Empathy allows a couple to form a strong "us vs. the world" boundary. By genuinely understanding the internal meaning and the gravity of the spiritual obligations placed upon a partner by their family, the other partner can provide validation and support. This demonstrates unity rather than division, proving that the relationship can withstand external opposition.
</p>

<p>
The ultimate functional conflict often involves the future of the union, particularly regarding children's religious identity. Without a clear resolution, this issue can be terminal for the relationship. Empathy facilitates a transition from demanding a "winner" to establishing a shared value system. By focusing on universal values like morality, kindness, and honesty derived from both faiths, the couple shows mutual respect for the foundational value of each other's path.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, the resilience of interfaith relationships is directly proportional to the level of functional empathy exercised by the couple. Unlike passive tolerance, which implies merely "putting up with" differences, functional empathy means actively valuing those differences. By prioritizing active listening and focusing on the partner's spiritual experience over theological dogma, couples effectively build a sustainable foundation. Empathy proves that while the paths to the divine may differ, the shared destination of love, commitment, and fulfillment remains entirely attainable.

<div class="space-y-6 leading-relaxed text-slate-300">

    <p>
Digital platforms have become deeply integrated into daily life, especially in the modern era where almost every activity is supported by technology. People rely on digital platforms for online shopping, education, communication, financial transactions, entertainment, and many other purposes. Because digital platforms have become a necessity, users expect interfaces that are not only functional, but also visually appealing and emotionally comfortable. Emotional design is an approach that focuses on how interface visuals affect user feelings and psychological responses during digital interactions. Visual aesthetics such as color, layout, typography, image quality, and spacing are critical elements that shape first impressions. Studies show that users often create judgments within the first few seconds of using a platform, and these judgments are largely influenced by appearance (Bird, 2023). When a platform looks clean, modern, and professionally designed, users feel safe and confident. On the other hand, a messy or visually poor interface can quickly reduce trust and cause users to leave. Therefore, the role of emotional design in influencing user trust is highly significant and deserves deeper exploration in the digital experience context.
    </p>

    <p>
A clean and simple layout is one of the most fundamental elements that increase user trust. A well-organized interface helps users navigate easily without confusion and improves the overall user experience. When features, menus, and buttons are placed clearly and consistently, users do not feel lost or overwhelmed. The use of sufficient white space allows information to breathe and prevents cognitive overload. Clean design communicates honesty, structure, and safety, which are essential components of trust. In contrast, a cluttered layout filled with advertisements, pop-up notifications, or unstructured content can make users feel uncomfortable and suspicious. Such design often resembles unprofessional websites or even online scams, which immediately creates distrust and causes users to leave the platform (Reading, 2024).
    </p>

    <p>
Color also plays a crucial role in influencing users’ emotional reactions. Color psychology suggests that certain colors have strong symbolic meanings and can affect user behavior and perception. Soft and neutral colors such as blue, white, and green often create calming feelings and represent safety, balance, and clarity. Blue, for instance, is widely used by banks and health service platforms because it represents trust, reliability, and professionalism. Conversely, colors like bright red or neon yellow can create anxiety or stress when used excessively and are better suited only for warnings or urgent notifications. Poorly chosen color combinations decrease readability, reduce emotional comfort, and damage user trust. Users who feel visually overwhelmed are likely to stop using the platform and look for alternatives (WebDev, 2025). This shows that color selection is not merely aesthetic but an important psychological strategy that strengthens emotional connection and credibility.
    </p>

    <p>
High-quality visual elements such as clear images, readable typography, and professional iconography also play an important role in building user trust. First impressions are often formed from visual detail, and users can immediately sense the difference between high-quality and low-quality design. Platforms that use blurry images, pixelated graphics, or poorly chosen fonts appear unprofessional and unreliable. Users may question the legitimacy of the platform and fear cybersecurity risks such as scams or personal data theft. In contrast, platforms with sharp visuals, professional icons, and clean, readable fonts create an atmosphere of credibility and security. High-quality visuals demonstrate that developers pay attention to detail, user experience, and reliability (Refiana, 2025). Since users judge digital products quickly, visual clarity becomes a powerful factor in shaping trust and long-term engagement.
    </p>

    <p>
Another important element of emotional design is typography. The choice of font style, size, spacing, and consistency strongly affects readability and emotional comfort. Fonts that are too small or overly decorative can cause users to feel tired, confused, or frustrated, while clean and modern typography supports clarity and encourages longer engagement. The consistency of typography across pages also creates a sense of structure and reliability. When text is easy to read, users feel respected and supported. However, when typography is chaotic or inconsistent, users may assume that the platform is poorly designed and untrustworthy (Handayani, 2025).
    </p>

    <p>
In conclusion, emotional design and visual aesthetics significantly influence user trust in digital platforms. Clean layout, carefully selected colors, and high-quality visual elements help users feel safe, confident, and comfortable, while poor design choices such as messy layouts, overwhelming colors, and low-quality visuals can damage trust and cause users to leave the platform. Therefore, emotional design must be seen not simply as decoration, but as a key strategy for building trust and improving overall user experience. As reliance on digital technology continues to increase, the importance of emotional design will continue to grow and shape the future of digital interaction (Wang, 2025).

<div class="space-y-6 leading-relaxed text-slate-300">

<p>
In today’s digital era, greenhouse cultivation systems have rapidly advanced
through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT),
enabling far greater precision and efficiency compared to traditional agricultural
practices. Sensor-based automation is now widely used to monitor and regulate
environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and nutrient
availability in real time, leading to more sustainable and productive greenhouse
operations. Research indicates that AI technologies integrated into smart
greenhouses can enhance crop yields, optimize resource use, and reduce the risks
of pest and disease outbreaks, thereby strengthening long-term agricultural
sustainability (Maraveas, 2023). As IoT devices generate increasingly complex
environmental datasets, AI methods such as boosting algorithms have become
essential for producing accurate predictions and supporting automated
decision-making processes. Consequently, boosting algorithms have emerged as a
core component in the development of intelligent greenhouse systems focused on
maximizing productivity and resource efficiency.
</p>

<p>
Boosting algorithms operate by iteratively combining numerous weak
learners, typically shallow decision trees, into a robust predictive model that
progressively reduces errors. In every boosting iteration, the new learner is trained to
emphasize the misclassified or high-error samples from the previous model, creating
a sequential learning process that focuses on correcting past mistakes. This
mechanism enables boosting to capture complex, nonlinear interactions within
sensor-generated environmental data that traditional models often fail to identify.
Modern boosting variants build on this foundation with optimized strategies for
instance, state-of-the-art comparisons show that frameworks such as XGBoost,
LightGBM, and CatBoost are tuned to balance accuracy, computational efficiency,
and generalization performance when handling large tabular data (Bentéjac et al.,
2021). LightGBM further accelerates training with a leaf-wise tree growth strategy
and introduces Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature
Bundling (EFB), enabling efficient processing of high-dimensional greenhouse data
(Li et al., 2023). Boosting consistently outperforms other ensemble approaches in
both regression and classification tasks, particularly under noisy or imbalanced
environmental conditions (Kumar et al., 2022). Such capabilities make boosting
especially valuable for greenhouse applications, where microclimatic variations and
sensor noise demand highly adaptive and precise predictive models.
</p>

<p>
Beyond their algorithmic strengths, boosting models play a critical role in
predicting greenhouse environmental dynamics and resource needs. Their ability to
detect subtle shifts in temperature, humidity, or light intensity allows them to
generate highly reliable forecasts essential for automated control. For instance,
XGBoost has been reported to predict plant water requirements with nearly 97%
accuracy, enabling irrigation systems to activate only when necessary and reducing
water use by approximately 42% while maintaining optimal hydration (Ghiat et al.,
2025). In a broader comparative study, IoT-enabled greenhouses equipped with
automated fertilization and irrigation demonstrated up to 89% higher crop yields
while reducing water and fertilizer usage by 41% and 91%, respectively (Pizzileo et
al., 2025). Through these capabilities, boosting algorithms contribute to smarter,
more sustainable greenhouse management by ensuring that key resources are
applied precisely where and when they are needed.
</p>

<p>
Another powerful capability of boosting algorithms is early plant disease and
stress detection, which is particularly critical in greenhouse environments where
pathogens and environmental stressors thrive under warm, humid conditions.
Boosting algorithms, especially when combined with image-processing and
hyperspectral imaging, can identify disease or physiological stress patterns long
before visual symptoms become apparent. For instance, a recent study using
XGBoost with optimized hyper-parameters successfully classified diseased vs.
healthy leaves across multiple datasets (Tomato, Rice, PlantVillage), achieving
accuracy, precision, and recall rates that outperform many conventional classifiers
(Majumdar, 2025). Similarly, in a study using hyperspectral imaging of Brassica
juncea leaves, boosting models (AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM) accurately
predicted internal metabolites such as chlorophyll and flavonoids, indicators
correlated with plant health and stress levels, thus demonstrating non-destructive
stress and nutrient-status monitoring capabilities (Yoon et al., 2023). Through these
applications, early disease detection, stress/nutrient status monitoring, and optimized
climate/irrigation control, boosting algorithms prove to be a versatile tool in building
robust early-warning systems for greenhouse agriculture.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, boosting algorithms serve as a cornerstone for modern smart
greenhouse automation. Their ability to provide highly accurate predictions, optimize
key agricultural resources, and detect plant diseases in their earliest stages gives
growers powerful tools to enhance productivity and sustainability. While initial setup
may require investment in sensors, computing systems, and technical training, the
long-term benefits, including reduced water and energy usage, improved crop health,
and enhanced yield reliability, make boosting algorithms indispensable in the era of
digital agriculture. As AI and IoT technologies continue to advance, boosting
algorithms will become even more integral to solving global agricultural challenges
such as resource scarcity, climate instability, and increasing food demand. Ultimately,
their integration into greenhouse management systems represents a major step
toward creating efficient, resilient, and environmentally responsible agricultural
practices for the future.

<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
My name is Farhan from Sidoarjo, and I’m a seventh-semester university student. I enjoy playing badminton, but lately I haven’t played much because I’ve been busy with assignments. This semester I’ve started hanging out more—like many people my age—sometimes at friends’ houses, sometimes at roadside coffee stalls, cafés, or anywhere that offers a change of scenery.
</p>

<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
These days I often grab coffee and hang out in the morning at places that are off the beaten path—not at home, coffee stalls, or cafés. I go to lesser-visited spots in Sidoarjo such as Lapindo, Lembah Dieng, and Ranu Manduro. I recommend visiting Lapindo at dawn to catch the sunrise; the view is similar to watching the sun rise over the beach. At night Lapindo is just as lovely—calm air, a gentle breeze, and the sound and sight of passing vehicles from atop the embankment. Another perk is that early in the morning or at night you typically don’t have to pay an entrance fee. Just bring a camp chair and some drinks to enjoy the atmosphere.
</p>

<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
Lembah Dieng and Ranu Manduro are great for both sunrise and sunset. Unlike Lapindo, these places usually have entrance gates, and because they’re more remote they can feel a bit eerie at night. I suggest going in the morning, when the vibe is peaceful. As with Lapindo, simply bring a camp chair, drinks, and some snacks—and be prepared to pay the entrance fee where it applies.
</p>

<p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
That’s a bit about what I’ve been doing lately and my recommendations for off-the-beaten-path hangout spots in Sidoarjo.

                    { id: 'ajeng-3', type: 'Essay', title: 'Predicting Indoor Objects on 2D LiDAR Point Cloud Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) ', date: 'Jan 5, 2026', image: 'img/lidar.jpg', content: `
<div class="space-y-6 leading-relaxed text-slate-300">

<p>
Understanding indoor environments is an important challenge in modern robotics, especially for robots that operate inside homes, offices, hospitals, or public buildings. One of the technologies commonly used for indoor sensing is LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging. A 2D LiDAR sensor works by sending out laser beams and measuring how long it takes for the light to return after hitting an object. From this process, the sensor produces a 2D point cloud, a collection of points that represent the distance and shape of objects around it. At the same time, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deep learning models known for their strong ability to learn visual and spatial patterns from data. While CNNs are mostly used for images, researchers today are using them to analyze LiDAR point cloud data to identify and predict indoor objects. Although some argue that 2D LiDAR is limited because it only scans in one plane, many studies show that CNN can still extract useful features from this data. Therefore, predicting indoor objects on 2D LiDAR point clouds using CNN is effective because CNN improves accuracy, enhances spatial understanding in robots, and supports advanced indoor navigation systems.
</p>

<p>
To understand why CNN is suitable for this task, it is important to first recognize how 2D LiDAR and point cloud data work. A 2D LiDAR sensor rotates and sends thousands of laser beams per second to measure the distance of nearby objects. The result is a set of points that form the outline of walls, furniture, and obstacles inside a room. Although this data does not include height information, it still gives a clear horizontal view of the environment. For example, the point cloud can show the shapes of chairs, tables, and cabinets based on the distances measured around them. Because 2D LiDAR provides fast and accurate data, it is widely used in indoor robots for tasks such as mapping and obstacle detection. The patterns found in the point cloud can be analyzed by machine learning models to identify different types of indoor objects. Even though 2D LiDAR is less detailed than 3D LiDAR, it is cheaper, faster, and efficient for many indoor applications, making it a practical sensor for object prediction.
</p>

<p>
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) play an important role in processing this point cloud data. A CNN is a deep learning model that automatically learns important features from spatial data without requiring manual feature engineering. When 2D LiDAR point clouds are transformed into grid-like images, CNNs can read these grids just like they read traditional images. The model can then learn differences in shapes and patterns to distinguish between objects such as walls, tables, or chairs. One of the strengths of CNN is its ability to identify features at multiple levels, from simple edges to complex object structures. This means CNN can recognize how a table might appear in a point cloud scan even if it is partially blocked or scanned from different angles. CNNs also perform well with large datasets, becoming more accurate as they are trained with more examples. Because of these capabilities, CNN has become a powerful tool for predicting objects from 2D LiDAR data.
</p>

<p>
The benefits of using CNN-based prediction in indoor environments are especially valuable for robotics. When a robot can correctly predict objects around it using 2D LiDAR scans, its navigation becomes much safer and more intelligent. The robot can avoid obstacles more effectively, plan better movement paths, and generate detailed indoor maps. For example, a home cleaning robot can detect furniture positions and adjust its cleaning route automatically. Indoor delivery robots can identify hallways, doors, and objects to reach their destination without collisions. Security robots can recognize people or moving objects for monitoring purposes. Beyond robotics, this technology also supports smart building systems, where automatic devices need accurate understanding of room layout and furniture placement. By using CNN on 2D LiDAR data, these systems become more efficient in interacting with indoor environments.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, predicting indoor objects on 2D LiDAR point cloud using CNN is an important and promising research area. A 2D LiDAR sensor provides reliable and fast point cloud data, while CNN is able to learn meaningful patterns and object shapes from that data. Based on the discussion, this combination is effective because it supports object recognition, improves detection accuracy, and enhances indoor robot navigation. With these advantages, CNN-based prediction on 2D LiDAR point cloud has strong potential to support the development of smarter indoor robots and more advanced automation systems in the future.
